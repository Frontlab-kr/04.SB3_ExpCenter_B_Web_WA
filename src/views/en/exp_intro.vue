      We have witnessed and experienced numerous disaster scenes, such as the collapse of the Seongsu Bridge, the Sampoong Department Store collapse, and the Daegu subway fire. Each incident has reminded us of the importance of safety, awakening our sense of caution.<br>
      The fact that many past accidents were largely human-made shows how indifferent we may have become to safety. Changes in the environment, including climate change, and the increasing size and height of buildings, can lead to extensive loss of life and property when disasters occur. Since we cannot predict when or where a disaster may strike, knowing how to respond to emergencies in advance can be invaluable in reacting swiftly and safely when a disaster arises.
      <br>

      The Boramae Safety Experience Center includes specialized experience zones for four types of disasters—earthquakes, typhoons, fires, and traffic accidents—as well as areas to learn basic first aid, such as CPR, and the operation of various firefighting facilities. These realistic simulations offer citizens a chance to appreciate the importance of safety and heighten their awareness, making it a meaningful place to contemplate safety.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      We sincerely thank you for visiting the Boramae Safety Experience Center once again, and we promise to do our utmost to make this a place that enhances citizens' disaster response capabilities and safety awareness.
